## Building

1. Run `npm run-script build`
2. Browse `dist/` folder

## Running tests

This library is tested with [Node 10+](https://github.com/lokalise/node-lokalise-api/blob/master/.travis.yml). To test it locally:

1. Copypaste `.env.example` file as `.env`. Put your API token inside. The `.env` file is excluded from version control so your token is safe. All in all, we use pre-recorded cassettes, so the actual API requests won't be sent. However, providing at least some token is required.
2. Run `npm test`. Observe test results and coverage.

## Previewing the docs locally

1. Clone the repo.
2. `cd docs`
3. `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl=''`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000` and observe the docs.
